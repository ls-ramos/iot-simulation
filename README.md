## IOT Konker demonstration
This project is a simple simulation of a iot application with the konker plataform.

In this project the scenario simulated is a smart house where the user can control the lights and the cleaning robot of the house with his/her phone. Also it is simulated that the house has a presence sensor that can tell if the user is in the house or not (The phone could be used for that too but in this simulation the presence sensor was modeled as another device).

The structure of the project in konker is:
